# Project State

## Project
`pragalbhdwivedi/miniature-octo-doodle`

## Purpose
Modular local/cloud AI coding platform with a single AI gateway, browser UI, optional agent memory/code graph, and future multi-agent orchestration.

## Current phase
**Phase 1: COMPLETE on the target machine; PR review/merge pending**

Implementation branch: `feat/phase1-core`, based on refreshed `main` at `ba7a6bb`.
Review: draft PR [#6](https://github.com/pragalbhdwivedi/miniature-octo-doodle/pull/6).
See `docs/BUILD_STATUS.md` for measured results, including live provider and Edge browser tests.

## Hardware baseline
- Windows 11
- AMD Ryzen 7 4800H
- 64 GB RAM
- NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti, 4 GB VRAM
- 256 GB NVMe
- approximately 50 GB free at project start
- Docker Desktop + WSL2 expected

## Canonical architecture
Open WebUI / coding agent -> Agent Controller -> OpenViking + Graphify + Git/GitHub -> deterministic policy -> TypeSafe Jev decision layer -> LiteLLM -> OpenAI / Gemini / Claude / OmniRoute / optional Ollama/llama.cpp.

## Installed
Preflight validated Windows 11, Docker Desktop 29.8.0 / Compose 5.5.1,
WSL2 2.7.14.0, and NVIDIA visibility in Windows, Ubuntu, and a disposable
container using an already-installed image.

Deployed and healthy: PostgreSQL 16.15 Alpine, LiteLLM database 1.103.0,
Open WebUI 0.11.4 slim. Internal database, authentication, WebUI login and
gateway model discovery tests passed, including after an authorized Docker
Desktop restart. Existing unrelated workloads and volumes were preserved.

Windows HTTP access was restored on 2026-09-29 by switching the host's WSL
networking from mirrored to NAT and restarting WSL/Docker. Mirrored mode still
failed after a full WSL restart. Full core tests now pass via 127.0.0.1 and
localhost, including admin login and UI-to-gateway discovery. The exact upstream
defect is unresolved. The backed-up change and rollback procedure are recorded
in `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`; no firewall or Compose exposure changes were needed.

On 2026-09-29, after the user configured provider keys locally and requested the
next action, OpenAI and Gemini each passed a bounded live completion through
the scoped LiteLLM key. Edge became available: existing administrator sign-in,
model selection and rendered responses from both providers passed in a temporary
WebUI chat. No alternate headless browser method was needed.

## Implemented and validated within Phase 1
- Pinned core Compose, persistent volumes, health checks, local-only publication.
- Guarded preflight/startup, random local secrets, restricted WebUI inference key.
- OpenAI/Gemini configuration with independently configurable model IDs/aliases.
- Empty-provider startup and both configured providers tested; live browser chat passed.
- Repeatable opt-in live probe: `scripts/test-providers.ps1 -RunLive`.
- Latest storage sample: 59.19 GiB free on C:; core image sizes sum to 2.68 GiB.

## Next bounded action
Review PR #6, then implement Phase 2 deterministic policy, TypeSafe Jev synthetic evaluation, gateway aliases, routing/fallback policy, budgets and local-private isolation. These controls are not yet implemented;
Phase 1 completion is not production or recovery certification. Recovery,
Kubernetes and optional modules remain later phases. NAT applies to all WSL2
distributions; direct WSL LAN access and
Linux-to-Windows localhost semantics change. All 31 running workload identities
and six volumes were preserved; unrelated applications were not functionally tested.
No reboot, firewall changes or data deletion was performed.

## Phase 2 design checkpoint
- TypeSafe Jev is the selected structured decision-layer evaluation target.
- Deterministic policy remains authoritative for data classes, provider allowlists, tools, spend limits and human approval.
- LiteLLM remains the mandatory execution gateway.
- Jev is **not installed or tested yet**; no TypeSafe API key or runtime state is present in this repository.
- Low-confidence/outage behavior must fail to deterministic routing or human review.
- Provider fallback must never broaden data exposure.
- The discussion catalogue is in `docs/MODELS_AND_SKILLS.md`.

## Deferred / optional
- Anthropic / Claude
- OmniRoute
- Ollama
- local LLM
- OpenViking
- Graphify
- coding agent
- Agent Controller
- Kubernetes runtime
- extended observability

## Storage policy
- warning threshold: <25 GB free
- critical threshold: <15 GB free
- initial target: keep new core footprint around 10-12 GB where practical
- do not download local models automatically
- do not duplicate local models between Docker and Kubernetes

## Completion rule
Do not mark a subsystem COMPLETE until it has been run and tested on the target machine. Architecture documents are not implementation evidence.
